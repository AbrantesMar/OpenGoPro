# Python Tutorial

This directory contains a series of tutorials (sample python script and accompanying .html walk-throughs)
to implement basic functionality to interact with a GoPro device using Python.

The tutorials will provide a walk-through to use Python to exercise the
[Open GoPro Interface](https://github.com/gopro/OpenGoPro) using [bleak](https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html)
for Bluetooth Low Energy (ble) and [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) for HTTP.
It is ok not to have read the interface documentation first as we will describe it as needed here.
After completing the tutorials, you will need to reference it for future development.

## Usage

Choose a tutorial subdirectory. Enter it and read through the tutorial.html walk-through.

> The tutorials are designed as a series of "labs" to be completed in order.

## This Demo vs the Open GoPro Python Package

Note! These are extremely stripped down Python tutorials that are only meant to show the basics. For a complete
Python SDK that uses [bleak](https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as the backend as well as a
cross-platform WiFi backend to easily write Python apps that control the GoPro, see: [TODO](www.TODO.com)
